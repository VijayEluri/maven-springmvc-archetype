Summary
-------
Maven archetype providing a pre-configured Spring MVC setup out of the box. The setup represents how I like things configured for a quick setup so YMMV.

This is my first archetype so feel free to send patches if you find something that can be improved.

Features
--------
Some features that work out of the box are:

* Bare bones Spring MVC controller and test.
* Tomcat ready (maven plugin and basic context.xml with JNDI datasource).
* Annotation driven Spring MVC controllers.
* Component scan configuration to automatically configure stereotype annotated beans.
* Configured ContentNegotiatingViewResolver, with JSON as a registered media type.
* JSTL view resolver.
* Cookie based locale resolver / interceptor.
* Annotation driven transaction support.
* UTF-8 character encoding filter for web pages.
* Spring taglib support.
* i18n support via Spring MessageSource.
* JNDI configured DataSource and JdbcTemplate and TransactionManager configuration.
* PropertyPlaceholder support.


Local Install
-------------
cd maven-springmvc-archetype
mvn install


Use
---
cd ~/work (or wherever you want to build to)

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.dtzq \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-springmvc-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=com.dtzq \
  -DartifactId=the_artifact_id \
  -Dpackage=the_package_name \
  -DjndiDataSource=data_source_name \
  -DlogPath=/path/to/log.file

mvn package

A WAR ready for deployment will be in target/ as $artifactId.war.

Answer the questions and the build will end up in a directory named after your artifact ID.


Change log:
--
October 15, 2011
* Update version to 1.1-SNAPSHOT.
* Removed webapp/static directory. Consider hosting these elsewhere.
* Removed WEB-INF/classes and WEB-INF/lib, these should be generated / contents ignore by the generated project.
* Converted package.html files to package-info.java.
* Removed unneeded imports.
* Updated taglib prefix, update web.xml verson to 2.5.
* Rename web-beans.xml to application-beans.xml. Minor change but seemed redundant due to the dispatcher servlet beans configuration.
* Updated context path in context.xml to reflect the artifact id.
* Removed unused AOP namespace from datasource-beans.xml.
* Update taglib definition into jsp-config block in web.xml.
* Update path to application-beans.xml in web.xml.
* Fixed "Use" section to reflect "-Dpackage" instead of "-DpackageName", fixed refs that were using artifactId and groupId with just the package variable.
* Removed incomplete surefire definition in pom.xml.
